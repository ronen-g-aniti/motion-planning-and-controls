# Enhancing Autonomous Navigation with an Advanced RRT Algorithm

## Introduction

In the realm of autonomous navigation, the challenge of efficiently and safely planning a path in complex environments is paramount. The project I undertook, involving the development of an enhanced Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm with a novel steering function, stands as a testament to the application of mechanical engineering principles, mathematical rigor, and innovative algorithm design. This endeavor not only showcases my capability to innovate within the field of autonomous navigation but also integrates sophisticated collision detection logic to ensure path feasibility and safety.

## Core Algorithm Components

### State Representation and Steering Mechanism

At the heart of our algorithm is a refined state representation, incorporating both position $\((x, y, z)\)$ and orientation $\((	heta_x, 	heta_y, 	heta_z)\)$ components. The orientation is crucial for navigating through three-dimensional spaces, allowing for rotational movement about multiple axes. The steering function, drawing inspiration from Rodrigues' rotation formula, adeptly calculates new orientations, facilitating smooth and precise directional control.

The Rodrigues' rotation formula is defined as:
$\[R = I + \sin(\phi)K + (1 - \cos(\phi))K^2\]$
where $\(R\)$ is the rotation matrix, $\(I\)$ is the identity matrix, $\(\phi\)$ is the angle of rotation, and $\(K\)$ is the skew-symmetric matrix formed from the axis of rotation.

### Forward Integration Process

The algorithm's forward integration step is key to transitioning between states. It meticulously applies velocity \((v)\) and time step \((\Delta t)\) to the new orientation determined by the steering mechanism. This process exemplifies the algorithm's nuanced approach to advancing towards the goal, highlighting its adherence to motion parameters and dynamic constraints.

## Collision Detection Logic

A suite of functions underpins the collision detection logic, ensuring paths avoid obstacles and remain within environmental bounds. This multi-faceted approach underscores the algorithm's robustness and reliability.

### Optimized Collision Checks

The `collision_check_vectorized` function showcases the algorithm's computational efficiency, using numpy's capabilities to quickly assess potential collisions. This method exemplifies the emphasis on performance without compromising accuracy.

### Spatial and Environmental Constraints

Checks for spatial and environmental boundaries are crucial, ensuring paths remain viable within the defined parameters. Functions like `inside_environment` play a pivotal role in reinforcing the algorithm's feasibility for real-world applications.

### Comprehensive Path Segment Evaluation

The meticulous evaluation of path segments through the `collision_check_two_points` function highlights the algorithm's thoroughness. This approach ensures every step towards the goal is assessed for viability and safety, illustrating the depth of the algorithm's navigational logic.

## Pseudocode of the RRT Algorithm

```plaintext

    a. Sample random point, with bias towards the goal
    b. Find nearest state in tree to the sampled point
    c. Steer from nearest state towards sampled point, employing:
        i. Rodrigues' rotation to calculate new orientation
        ii. Forward integration based on new orientation and predefined speed
    d. Add the new state to the tree if it's valid (non-colliding and within environment bounds)
3. Construct path back to start if goal reached within a tolerance threshold
```

## Conclusion

This detailed exposition of an advanced RRT algorithm, enriched with a novel steering function and integrated collision detection mechanisms, illuminates my project's contribution to the field of autonomous navigation. It demonstrates not only a mastery of technical skills and innovative thinking but also the potential for significant advancements in mechanical engineering and robotics.
