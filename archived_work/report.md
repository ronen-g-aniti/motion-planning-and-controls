# Exploring Some of the Motion Planning and Control Algorithms Used in the Field of Autonomous Quadcopter Flight

## The Preface
My name is Ronen Aniti, and I am a college graduate with a Bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from The University of Texas at Austin’s Cockrell School of Engineering. I graduated from that degree program in December of 2016. After graduating, I became a professional private tutor, founding a business called Ronen Redefines Tutoring, through which I have not only helped over 200 students prepare for standardized tests and college entrance but also deepened my interest in logical reasoning and mathematics. For the past two years, I have been considering transitioning careers to become an engineer or a scientist. I want to put my skills on display, so I am taking it upon myself to prove them with a project. That’s what this report will be about. 

## The Background
I am writing this report as I complete the first milestone of the project. The project involves developing a path planning program in Python to aid a virtual quadcopter in navigating a simulated model environment of a San Francisco city block. I found this project on a website called Udacity, the educational platform that offers Nanodegree credentials for a variety of interesting topics, from data science to autonomous vehicles. It’s the latter subject that piqued my interest when I first visited the site, in search of a project to work on. Three things stood out to me about the Flying Car and Autonomous Flight Nanodegree: the math was involved, there would be projects, and I was eligible for a discount. It wasn’t just those things, though. The program offered an opportunity to learn a new skill set and to introduce myself to a new topic. The Nanodegree seemed like it would be a challenge that–if I were to follow through with completing–could prove rewarding. That’s exactly what I was looking for.

There are three components to the nanodegree: there’s lecture material that provides high-level coverage of concepts, there’re the programming exercises following each module, which provide an opportunity to implement the concept being taught, and there’re projects that follow each of the main sections of the course. I am writing this report as I complete the project that follows the first main section, which is on a topic called path planning. Ahead lies a project involving developing a control system for an simulated autonomous quadcopter, a project involving developing a state estimation algorithm for a simulated autonomous quadcopter, and a project involving developing a control system for a simulated autonomous fixed-wing aircraft. If you don’t know what those things are, don’t worry. Actually, I hardly do. This project, that I am sharing with you here, is the beginning of my journey in discovering what they are about.

The topic of path planning, which itself is a subtopic of the more general notion of motion planning, is the idea of developing algorithms to enable an autonomous vehicle to find its way around its own physical environment in a safe manner–so without colliding with obstacles like trees, people, or buildings. In the case of this project, the autonomous vehicle is a computer model of a quadcopter drone that exists inside of a simulation program called the Flying Car Nanodegree Simulator, developed by Udacity. For now, the simulator will handle what are called the “low-level” controls for the quadcopter, namely controlling the rotation rates of each motor. What I will be focusing on is developing code in Python that will, provided with some start location within the city block and some goal location within the city block, produce a sequence of waypoints, a path, for the drone to follow in order to reach the destination safely. 

## The Problem
The problem of writing a program that is capable of producing flyable paths for the simulated quadcopter to follow through the 3D virtual environment of the San Francisco city block is the problem that Udacity is requesting that I solve. Udacity is providing starter code that establishes a connection with the drone simulator and establishes a framework that can be extended to enable the drone to listen to and respond to events that occur inside of the simulation environment, such as the drone receiving new measurement readings from its onboard sensors or the drone nearing within a certain threshold distance of a target waypoint. Udacity is also providing a data file that contains the positions and dimensions of the obstacles of the virtual city block, with obstacles being discretized in such a way that each is represented as the union of one or more 3D boxes with, for the most part, a length and width of 10 meters and a height that varies from three meters for the shortest tree located on the city block’s northeast foliage to 212 meters for the block’s tallest building.



Figure 1. The Flying Car Nanodegree Simulator is a tool that simulates numerically and visualizes the flight of an autonomous quadcopter drone as its control system receives the waypoint commands produced by the computer program I develop in this project.



Figure 2. The path planning algorithm I develop in this project must be capable of providing the autonomous agent inside of the simulator with waypoint commands that navigate the drone safely through the urban environment without causing the drone to collide with obstacles, like buildings or trees.

For context, the course’s lesson material introduced several path planning algorithms. There were the sampling-based routines, namely, the probabilistic roadmap and the rapidly-exploring random tree, which return a waypoint sequence by traversing a randomly sampled subset of position-orientation combinations or ”states” from the set of all such states available for the drone to fly to inside of the 3D environment. There were the geometry-heavy techniques, like the Voronoi and medial axis methods, which involved discretizing the environment into spatial regions whose boundaries represent safe-to-fly routes and searching that discretization with another computer algorithm to find a waypoint sequence from a start position to a goal position that is both as short as possible and maintains distance from obstacles. Finally, there was the potential field technique, a more math-intensive technique that involves directing the drone’s motion according to the output of a vector-valued function that models the interaction between attractive forces that pull the drone towards goal locations and repulsive forces that push the drone away from obstacles. 

I had work cut out for me. It would be up to me to get comfortable enough with these techniques in order to make an informed decision about which ones I would want to include in my solution code. It would be up to me to ensure that the solution I submit to Udacity is efficient enough such that it’s able to produce planning commands within the fractions of a second that are between the drone’s sensor updates. And finally, it would be up to me to ensure that I make something of this project. This project is something that I’m doing by choice, independently. In fact, I took on a second job near my home that is part-time just to complement the income I’m earning tutoring so that I’d be earning enough money to fund this nanodegree and work towards completing the credential without feeling rushed. It’s important to me that I create something that I’m proud of by the end. 

Two principles that I’ve come to value as a result of being a tutor guide my work: 1. It’s important to develop an understanding of foundational concepts when entering a new line of study and 2. It’s important to challenge one’s skills on a regular basis.
